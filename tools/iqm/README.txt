*** Format information ***

"iqm.txt" contains a description of the Inter-Quake Model (IQM) format.
"iqe.txt" contains a description of the Inter-Quake Export (IQE) format.


*** Blender export ***

blender-2.49/iqm_export.py, blender-2.56/iqm_export.py, and blender-2.57/iqm_export.py are exporter scripts for Blender 2.49, Blender 2.56, and Blender 2.57 respectively. It can either directly export an IQM file (if the output filename has an ".iqm" suffix), or it can export an IQE file (if the output filename has an ".iqe" suffx) for use with the IQM compiler.

The "Meshes" toggle controls whether to export meshes in the IQM.
The "Bounding boxes" toggle controls whether to generate per-frame bounding boxes for each animation frame. This only works if the IQM contains meshes. This option can take a while, so turning it off while doing test exports of a model and re-enabling it on the final export may be a good idea.
The "Animations" field contains a comma (",") separated list of action names to export. The names can also be of the form "name:X:Y", where X is the start frame number, and Y is the end frame number.
The "De-rigify" toggle can be used to optimize certain skeletons generated by the rigify script to export only deformation bones.


*** IQM compiler ***

The IQM compiler can be used to compile MD5, SMD, or IQE files into IQM files.

It is run as follows:

./iqm [options] output.iqm mesh.iqe anim1.iqe ... animN.iqe

./iqm [options] output.iqm mesh.md5mesh anim1.md5anim ... animN.md5anim

./iqm [options] output.iqm mesh.smd anim1.smd ... animN.md5anim

Options can be any of the following command-line switches:

-s N
  Sets the output scale to N.

You can supply either a mesh file, animation files, or both.
Note that if an input mesh file is supplied, it must come before the animation files in the file list.
The output IQM file will contain the supplied mesh and any supplied animations.
If no mesh is provided, the IQM file will simply contain the supplied animations.

The included Makefile can be used to build the IQM compiler.


*** IQM upgrader ***

The IQM upgrader is a small little program to convert older versions of IQM files to the most recent version. Ideally you should regenerate the IQM files using the exporters or the compiler, but if necessary, the upgrader will try to generate a new version while manipulating as little of the data as possible.

It is run as follows:

./upgrade output.iqm input.iqm

The included Makefile can be used to build the IQM upgrader.


*** Code examples ***

Please see the included "demo" directory for examples of loading and using IQM models.

The "demo" program shows a simple rendering example using OpenGL fixed-function rendering and GLUT.
The "gpu-demo" program shows GPU-accelerated skinning using OpenGL GLSL rendering and GLUT.

The IQM compiler (iqm.cpp) and the IQM blender exporter (blender*/iqm_export.py) are licensed as public domain.
